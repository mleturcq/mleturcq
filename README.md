# About me

I'm full-time researcher at INED (French Institute for Demographic Studies, Paris). 

I work on family economics, labor economics and the consequences of the changes in family structures on poverty, inequalities and wealth accumulation. I also work on gender wage differences within firms. 

I'm PI of the ANR grant WIDE (Wealth Inequality and Demographic Events). 

I'm founding member and president of the Afépop (Association Françaises des Economistes de la Population) 🧑‍🎓

I'm also a rower and a bridge player 🚣 🎴
